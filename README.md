This is a port of Atom's One Dark color scheme for Termite.

After I tried porting a couple of iTerm/Terminal.app schemes via [Terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy/) with little to no success (imo), I decided to recreate the scheme myself.

All the colors were extracted directly from the Atom theme, so initially there were some missing light color values. I added my own take on them, however I do think there is room for improvement. If you have any suggestions, feel free to submit an issue or a PR :)

Enjoy this wonderful color scheme in your terminal!
